## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Small and marginal farmers must become modern because technology has already been developed and should be implemented in the agricultural field. The progress of our country depends on the modernization of agriculture, and this will only be possible when farmers adopt new techniques, tools, and methods. If farmers are left behind as traditional and underdeveloped, it will hinder the overall growth of the nation. Therefore, it is our responsibility to support them with resources, training, and access to modern facilities so that they can improve productivity and contribute effectively to national development.


Expected Outcomes

1. Smart Drip Irrigation System (IoT + AI)
   IoT sensors placed in the soil measure moisture, temperature, and humidity.
   AI algorithms analyze weather forecasts and crop needs, then automatically regulate the drip irrigation system.
   Outcome: Saves water, prevents over-irrigation, and ensures crops get just the right amount of water.
2. AI-Based Multi-Crop Planning Assistant
   Farmers input their land size, soil type, and budget into a mobile app.
   An AI model suggests the best multi-crop combinations (e.g., cereals + pulses + vegetables) based on soil fertility, season, and market demand.
   Outcome: Diversified income, reduced crop failure risk, and improved market value.
3. IoT Soil Fertility Tracker
   Low-cost IoT soil sensors detect nutrient levels (NPK – nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium).
   AI generates a customized fertilizer and organic manure plan for farmers.
   The system also recommends crop rotation strategies to maintain long-term soil fertility.
   Outcome: Healthier soil, reduced input costs, and sustainable farming.
4. AI-Powered Crop Monitoring with Drones
   Drones capture aerial images of fields.
   AI processes the images to detect pest attacks, crop diseases, or nutrient deficiencies early.
   Farmers receive real-time alerts on their phone with treatment suggestions.
   Outcome: Prevents large-scale crop loss and reduces pesticide overuse.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Archers and Extinsion services
• Government and policy makers
• Producers and consumers
• Agro industries

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.
