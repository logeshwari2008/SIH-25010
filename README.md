## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Small and marginal farmers must become modern because technology has already been developed and should be implemented in the agricultural field. The progress of our country depends on the modernization of agriculture, and this will only be possible when farmers adopt new techniques, tools, and methods. If farmers are left behind as traditional and underdeveloped, it will hinder the overall growth of the nation. Therefore, it is our responsibility to support them with resources, training, and access to modern facilities so that they can improve productivity and contribute effectively to national development.



Expected Outcomes

1. Smart Drip Irrigation System (IoT + AI)
   IoT sensors placed in the soil measure moisture, temperature, and humidity.
   AI algorithms analyze weather forecasts and crop needs, then automatically regulate the drip irrigation system.
   Outcome: Saves water, prevents over-irrigation, and ensures crops get just the right amount of water.
2. AI-Based Multi-Crop Planning Assistant
   Farmers input their land size, soil type, and budget into a mobile app.
   An AI model suggests the best multi-crop combinations (e.g., cereals + pulses + vegetables) based on soil fertility, season, and market demand.
   Outcome: Diversified income, reduced crop failure risk, and improved market value.
3. IoT Soil Fertility Tracker
   Low-cost IoT soil sensors detect nutrient levels (NPK – nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium).
   AI generates a customized fertilizer and organic manure plan for farmers.
   The system also recommends crop rotation strategies to maintain long-term soil fertility.
   Outcome: Healthier soil, reduced input costs, and sustainable farming.
4. AI-Powered Crop Monitoring with Drones
   Drones capture aerial images of fields.
   AI processes the images to detect pest attacks, crop diseases, or nutrient deficiencies early.
   Farmers receive real-time alerts on their phone with treatment suggestions.
   Outcome: Prevents large-scale crop loss and reduces pesticide overuse.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Archers and Extinsion services
• Government and policy makers
• Producers and consumers
• Agro industries

Supporting Data

1.Productivity & Resource Use – Drip irrigation can save up to 60% water and increase yields by 30–50%, while multi-cropping improves soil fertility by 20–25% and reduces income loss risks by 40%.
2.Farmer Income & Cost Efficiency – AI- and IoT-enabled precision farming reduces input costs by 15–20% and raises farmer incomes by 10–15%, supporting small and marginal farmers.
3.National Impact – With only 12% of irrigated land under micro-irrigation and 30% of soils degraded, scaling these solutions can significantly boost food security, sustainability, and rural livelihoods across India.

## Proposed Solution
<ul><li>Technologies such as drip irrigation, multi-crop sowing, and soil fertility improvement can transform agriculture at the grassroots level. Drip irrigation saves water and delivers it directly to plant roots, ensuring efficiency in water-scarce regions. Multi-crop sowing reduces the risk of crop failure while diversifying income sources, and soil fertility management through organic methods and crop rotation ensures long-term sustainability. These practices, when integrated, create a strong foundation for resilient and productive farming.</li>
<li>Water Efficiency: Supplies water directly to roots, reducing wastage by 40–60%.
Cost Saving: Farmers spend less on water and electricity for pumping.
Risk Diversification: If one crop fails due to pests, disease, or weather, others still provide income.
Better Soil Health: Different crops replenish nutrients naturally, improving fertility.
Higher Income: Growing vegetables, cereals, and pulses together increases profit opportunities.</li>
<li>The uniqueness of this solution lies in integrating modern practices like drip irrigation, multi-crop sowing, and soil fertility management with AI and IoT technologies to directly support small and marginal farmers. Unlike existing approaches, it provides a low-cost, farmer-friendly system that uses sensors and AI to optimize water use, suggest the best crop combinations, and maintain soil health. This innovation not only improves productivity and income but also ensures sustainability, resilience to climate change, and scalability for millions of farmers across the country.</li></ul>

## Feasibility and Viability
<h3>Sustainability and scalability</h3>
<ul><li>The idea is feasible as it relies on low-cost and readily available IoT hardware like soil moisture and NPK sensors with ESP32 controllers, combined with lightweight AI models in Python. The setup is affordable for small farmers, especially with government subsidies, and long-term savings in water, fertilizer, and electricity ensure quick returns. It is easy to operate through mobile apps in local languages, can run on solar power in rural areas, and provides clear benefits such as higher yields and income security, making adoption practical and farmer-friendly.</li>
<li>The key risks are the high initial setup cost for small farmers and limited digital literacy, along with connectivity and maintenance issues that could slow adoption of AI and IoT solutions.</li>
<li>Provide government subsidies and low-cost kits to reduce initial costs, deliver training in local languages to improve digital literacy, use solar-powered offline systems to handle connectivity issues, and set up local support centers for easy maintenance.</li></ul>
